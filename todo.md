# As a user I want to be able to:

- Find any places a field is used as:
  - A validation rule
  - A conditional criteria
  - A page rule
  - A concatenation value
  - A display field
- View a Task detail page
  - Ideally this page will contain all the metadata about a task that would normally be viewed in the builder
- View a "View" detail page
-
